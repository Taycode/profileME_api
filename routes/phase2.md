# Question 1.1 answer

I dont really think this is much of a mathematical problem,  i just think the students did not really have to have been thinking of when the tests were supposed to hold, but rather prepare for it since the test could be given at any day. I do not see anything wrong with their thinking either, as I think it is typical of the regular human.
